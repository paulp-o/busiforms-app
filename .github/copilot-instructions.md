# Instructions

We are building a web application using NestJS for the backend and Next.js for the frontend. The project leverages modern tools such as React Hook Forms for form handling, Prisma for database management, and Axios for API requests. It utilizes React 18, Tabler Icons for UI icons, and Zod for schema validation. For styling, we are using Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI to create a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interface.
